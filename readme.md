Interesting about Go:

- standard built-in syntax checking and style format: no endless complains about tab versus spaces (no unused variables allowed, using camelCase and warn about snakecase)
- priority is clarity of intent and readability, so there are explicit type conversions instead of automatic
- Go is a call by value language
- len, append, make, copy are standard build-in functions
- no standard set
- intuitive use of Map -> JSON like, very similar like a slice
- try avoiding shadowing at all times!
